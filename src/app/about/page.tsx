            </h2>
            
            <p>
              You're at a coffee shop, and there's someone working on the same project as you...
            </p>
            
            <p>
              You're at a concert, and the person next to you knows every single lyric...
            </p>
            
            <p>
              You're in class, and someone just cracked the funniest joke, but you don't know them...
            </p>
            
            <p>
              You're walking around campus, and you keep seeing the same person everywhere...
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>What do you do?</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Nothing. You just... walk away. Because asking for someone's socials IRL feels awkward, right?

            <p>
              Social media was supposed to bring us together. Instead, it made us:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="space-y-4 ml-6">
              <li>‚Ä¢ Scroll endlessly through strangers' lives</li>
              <li>‚Ä¢ Perform for likes instead of connecting with people</li>
              <li>‚Ä¢ Miss out on the amazing humans literally right next to us</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              That's where ArroundU comes in.
